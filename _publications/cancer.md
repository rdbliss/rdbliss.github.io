My *first publication* was completed under the sage guidance of the Abernathys
at the 2015 Winthrop University REU "Bridging Applied and Theoretical
Mathematics." I had just completed my freshman year at Oglethorpe, and knew
very little mathematics. I was glad to provide technical support to my
collaborators.

I look back *very* fondly on my time at Winthrop. The friends I made, the math
I learned, and the fun I had set me on the path of mathematics.
