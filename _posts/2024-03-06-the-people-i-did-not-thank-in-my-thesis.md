[My thesis](/files/thesis.pdf), which I defended last Monday, includes a big
list of acknowledgements. Unlike the very stately, presidential message above,
it does not include nods to haters or losers. It does include a few unusual
entities, like the United States and the Coca-Cola Foundation, but everything
remains positive.

Even taking a pretty expansive view of who deserved an acknowledgement, I still
made some omissions for space or style. Below is a list of entities, thanked
without constraints.

1. *Service workers*. Everyday, something in my life is easier because of
   cleaning staff, restaurant workers, delivery drivers, or other service
   workers. These men and women work hard, menial jobs and often get very
   little thanks or recognition (even less than administrative staff like
   secretaries). For example, the Rutgers math department cleaning staff often
   works at night, when you can't see them! Thank you to all the workers who
   make life a thousand times easier for all of us.

2. *Euclid et al.* Although "mathematics" consists of many people working
   constantly to push our boundary of knowledge forward, there are some people
   that pushed this boundary further than anyone else. The mathematical
   community owes a great debt to these legendary mathematicians of yore. Some
   of the "standard" mentions are Euler, Gauss, Newton, and Leibniz, but I feel
   that a special nod must be given to Euclid for being the first to shape
   mathematics into its modern form.

3. *Taxpayers*. About 66% of all academics work at public universities. Even
   outside of public universities, many grants are awarded by NSF, NSA, or
   other federal agencies, and students often pay tuition using federal loans.
   Maybe Princeton and Harvard could get by with private money, but the
   majority of academics work at places that can't. It is thanks to the United
   States and her citizens that I and most academics have work. A grateful
   thank you to them.

4. *Tech wizards*. It is unthinkable to do mathematics without the computer
   tools I use every day. Leslie Lamport and Don Knuth made $\LaTeX$, the
   symbolic computation group at the University of Waterloo created Maple, and
   Guido van Rossum designed the almost-perfect Python. I must give a special
   thank you to the late Bram Moolenaar, who created the truly stupendous text
   editor Vim. I do 90% of my work by writing notes in Vim, and that work is
   all the more pleasant and efficient thanks to him.

That covers just about everyone. At this point, if you haven't been thanked,
I have some bad news for you. If it's any consolation, I'm not dying, so you
still have a chance to do something really nice to make the *next* list. Better
start now!
