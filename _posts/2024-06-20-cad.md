Long ago I was amazed to read Zeilberger's *A = B*, a masterpiece on proving
binomial coefficient identities, and have ever since been surprised that more
people don't know about it. I recently had this feeling again while reading
[Kauers' overview of the cylindrical algebraic decomposition algorithm
(CAD)](http://www.algebra.uni-linz.ac.at/people/mkauers/publications/kauers11a.pdf).

The sales pitch is this: There exists an algorithm that can determine whether
any first-order statement about the reals involving polynomial equations and
inequalities is true or false. The precise statement is more technical, but
that's the idea[^more]. Apparently we've known that this algorithm has existed
since the 1960's, and have had an effective implementation since the 1970's.
Well, it was news to me!

[^more]: And even this pitch lowballs CAD. If you get into the underlying geometry, what CAD computes tells you *more* than whether particular first-order statements are true.

There are lots of silly examples I could give, but let me just dive into
a real, recent problem I was thinking about.

For which integers $a$ and $b$ does the cubic

$$
\begin{align*}
    f(s, t) = 1 - 2 a s &+ a^2 s^2 - b s^2 + s^3 + a b s^3 - b t \\
                        &- 3 s t + a b s t + a s^2 t + b^2 s^2 t + a t^2 + 2 b s t^2 + t^3
\end{align*}
$$

have a positive minimum on the region $\\{a s + bt \geq 1\\} \cap [0, 1]^2$?

This is an annoying problem. I solved it using computer algebra to automate my
calculus-based analysis, but I didn't get an answer I was happy with. CAD can
do it almost automatically!

We can phrase our question like this: For which $a, b$ does the formula

$$\forall s, t\ [0 \leq s, t \leq 1,\ as + bt \geq 1 \implies f(s, t) > 0]$$

hold? (Note that we don't need another variable for the minimum itself. The
region is compact, so $f(s, t) > 0$ is enough.) If we give this statement to
a CAD algorithm, then it will turn it into an *unquantified* statement, meaning
that it only depends on $a$ and $b$. Here's what Mathematica's built in CAD
does:

```
f = 1 - 2 a s + a^2 s^2 - b s^2 + s^3 + a b s^3 - b t - 3 s t + a b s t + a s^2 t + b^2 s^2 t + a t^2 + 2 b s t^2 + t^3
CylindricalDecomposition[
 ForAll[{s, t},
  Implies[0 <= s <= 1 && 0 <= t <= 1 && a*s + b*t >= 1, f > 0]],
 {b, a}]
(b <= -(17/4) && (a < (2 - b)/2 - 1/2 Sqrt[-4 + b^2] || a > Root[27 - 4 b^3 + 18 b #1 - b^2 #1^2 + 4 #1^3 &, 3]))
    || (-(17/4) < b <= -2 && (a < (2 - b)/2 - 1/2 Sqrt[-4 + b^2] || a > (2 - b)/2 + 1/2 Sqrt[-4 + b^2]))
    || -2 < b < 1
    || (1 <= b < 2.08... && a > Root[27 - 4 b^3 + 18 b #1 - b^2 #1^2 + 4 #1^3 &, 1])
    || (b == 2.08... && a > (2 - b)/2 + 1/2 Sqrt[-4 + b^2])
    || (b > 2.08... && a > Root[27 - 4 b^3 + 18 b #1 - b^2 #1^2 + 4 #1^3 &, 1])
```

The output is a disjoint union of conditions which, together, are equivalent to
our input. The full output is a bit messy, so here it is again with only the
parts relevant to "integers $b \geq 1$":

```
    (1 <= b < 2.08... && a > Root[27 - 4 b^3 + 18 b #1 - b^2 #1^2 + 4 #1^3 &, 1])
      || (b > 2.08... && a > Root[27 - 4 b^3 + 18 b #1 - b^2 #1^2 + 4 #1^3 &, 1])
```

And now, noticing that the inner condition on $a$ is the same in both clauses,
and that we only care about integer values, we see that this whole thing is equivalent to just this:

```
    a > Root[27 - 4 b^3 + 18 b #1 - b^2 #1^2 + 4 #1^3 &, 1]
```

This says that our original statement about $f$ is equivalent to "$a$ is larger
than the smallest root $x$ of the cubic $27 - 4 b^3 + 18 b x - b^2 x^2 + 4 x^3$." This sounds unhelpful, but it is actually quite strong.

Using CAD again, we can determine when this cubic has only one real root.
Because it's a cubic, this is the negation of the statement

$$\exists x < y < z \ [q(x) = q(y) = q(z) = 0],$$

where $q$ is the cubic in question. Let's pass that to Mathematica:

```
q = 27 - 4  b^3 + 18  b  x - b^2  x^2 + 4  x^3
CylindricalDecomposition[
 Exists[{x, y, z},
  x < y < z &&
   q == 0 && (q /. {x -> y}) == 0 && (x /. {x -> z}) == 0], {b}]

b < 1.89...
```

If $b > 1$ (we only care about integers), then the cubic only has one root. In
that case, because its leading coefficient in $x$ is positive, being larger
than the real root is equivalent to saying that the cubic is positive. If $b
= 1$, then we can just do CAD again but substitute $b = 1$ first, which reveals
that the condition is $a > -1$.

So, all together, we have this: If $b = 1$, then $f(s, t) > 0$ on the region
for all positive integers $a$; if $b \geq 2$, then $f(s, t) > 0$ on the region
if and only if

$$27 + 4 a^3 + 18 a b - a^2 b^2 - 4 b^3 > 0.$$

This is the very precise, quantitative statement I wanted all along, and it
only took a few minutes of computing time (plus some more exploring) to
discover. Amazing!
