title: I hate sports betting
---

It seems difficult to have strong opinions these days without getting into
dangerous territory. This is why it brings me great pleasure that [recent
events](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-illegal-gambling-arrests)
give me a reason to share one of my favorite strong opinions.

I hate sports betting companies. They make me sick. Their product is corrosive
to the spirit and poisonous to the mind. If President Trump ever wanted to test
his theory that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any
voters, I would suggest taking aim at the closest bookie.

This is not a *moral* position. I have no problem with gambling, just like
I have no problem with a man who drinks, a greedy woman, or with my students
who don't pay attention during lectures. I get it, vice is fun! To err is
human, to forgive is divine.

My real problem with sports betting companies is that *they do not respect the
game*. When you watch a [beer
commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3XnSXeaNow) during a Sunday
afternoon football game, you see friends and family coming together to spend
a day together cheering on their team. Long ago, when people still watched
baseball, you saw [commercials admiring the great Willie
Mays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP40WdUWvG4). There is a decade-old Super
Bowl commercial [*about cars*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7dvSXIWNaI)
that still brings a tear to my eye. These show a deep love for *something*, be
it the game, or family, or something about America.

The basic premise of sports betting commercials is that *sports are boring*.
["You want to make every game interesting? Put some skin in the
game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDZGKG756rE) The only thing that will
save you from a who-cares matchup between the Panthers and the Jets *is to put
some money on it!* They display a love for *nothing*, respect for *nothing*.
Only simulated excitement matters to them.

I cannot stand these commercials. I will welcome with open arms any company
premised on vice if it acknowledges that sports are beautiful, that America is
great, and that our icons are worth looking up to. Sports gambling companies do
the exact opposite.

I would strongly support slapping these companies with the same kinds of
restrictions we put on tobacco companies: no television ads, prominent displays
about the dangers of their products, and no advertising aimed towards children.
Then, once we convince Americans about the dangers of these products, we should
send bookies back to the slums where they belong: Atlantic City.
