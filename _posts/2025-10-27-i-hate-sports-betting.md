title: I hate sports betting
---

It seems difficult to have strong opinions these days without getting into
dangerous territory. This is why it brings me great pleasure that [recent
events](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-illegal-gambling-arrests)
give me a reason to share one of my favorite strong opinions.

I hate sports betting companies. They make me sick. This is not a *moral*
position. I have no problem with gambling, just like I have no problem with
drunkards or sloths or with students who don't pay attention during lectures.
I get it, vice is fun!

My real problem with sports betting companies is that *they do not respect the
game*. When you watch a [beer
commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3XnSXeaNow) during a Sunday
afternoon football game, you see friends and family coming together to spend
a day together cheering on their team. Long ago, when people still watched
baseball, you saw [commercials admiring the great Willie
Mays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP40WdUWvG4). There is a decade-old Super
Bowl commercial [*about cars*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7dvSXIWNaI)
that still brings a tear to my eye. These show a deep love for *something*, be
it the game, or family, or something about America.

The basic premise of sports betting commercials is that *sports are boring*.
["You want to make every game interesting? Put some skin in the
game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDZGKG756rE) The only thing that will
save you from a who-cares matchup between the Panthers and the Jets *is to put
some money on it!*

We should slap betting companies with the same kinds of restrictions we put on
tobacco companies. No television ads, prominent displays about the dangers of
their products, and no advertising aimed towards children. Then, once we
convince Americans about the dangers of these products, we should send bookies
back to the slums where they belong: Atlantic City.
