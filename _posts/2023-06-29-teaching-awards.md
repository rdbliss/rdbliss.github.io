*Written on Doron Zeilberger's $\lceil (e\pi)^2 \rceil$ birthday.*

This year I won two of the TA teaching awards given by the Rutgers math
department to graduate students. In the past 25 years the department has given
100 such awards, but only five people have ever won more than one, and none
more than two. I don't know if this is a Joe Pesci, ["Thank
you"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Q_nyjuEak) moment, or a Sally Fields,
["You like me!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_8nAvU0T5Y) moment. Either
way, I am glad to be in the company of many excellent teachers[^donations].

[^donations]: Each award comes with \\$200. I've donated \\$100 to the [OEIS](https://oeisf.org/) and \$100 to the [Wikimedia foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/).

I am particularly happy to contribute to the excellence of teaching in my
academic bloodline. I wrote a small script to gather data on the recipients of
teaching assistant awards, and am pleased to share the results.

Which advisor at Rutgers produces students who win the most teaching assistant
awards? Doron Zeilberger.

| Advisor[^data]    | Students | TA Excellence awards |
|:-----------|--------:|--------:|
| Zeilberger |      21 |      11 |
| Huang      |      12 |       5 |
| Woodward   |       9 |       4 |
| Tunnell    |       6 |       4 |
| Lepowsky   |      13 |       4 |

[^data]: This data was collected by matching teaching award recipients with
         their listed advisors on the graduation page. For current students who
         had not graduated, I attempted to determine their advisor myself. This
         worked for all but three current students.

    The data also only counts students who existed after the creation of the TA
    Excellence award. For example, Tunnel had 7 students in total, but one was
    before the award existed.

Of course, Professor Zeilberger has many students, which gives him more chances
to get lucky. To account for this, take advisors with at least five students
and sort by awards per student. Zeilberger is still second.

| Advisor    |Students | TA Excellence awards per student |
|:-----------|--------:|---------:|
| Tunnell    |       6 | 0.666667 |
| Zeilberger |      21 | 0.52381  |
| Woodward   |       9 | 0.444444 |
| Huang      |      12 | 0.416667 |
| Wilson     |       5 | 0.4      |

To really get a feel for this data you should just look at the picture.

While Zeilberger is very far away from the rest of the faculty, this scatter
plot does not convey how far away. Almost all advisors "produce" zero TA
teaching awards.

Even if you think that the TA Excellence awards are flukes, according to the
department only five math graduate students have ever won the more prestigious
School of Arts and Sciences Award for Distinguished Contributions to
Undergraduate Education. Four of them---Andrew Baxter, Lara Pudwell, Paul Raff,
and Matthew Russell---are Zeilberger students.

It does not surprise me that Dr. Z gets the best teachers. Here is the first
line of [Opinion 77](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion77.html):

> We professional academic mathematicians are lucky to be paid for something we
> enjoy doing the most, mathematical research. Many of us also enjoy teaching,
> and I for one, would be willing to pay, if I had to, for the privilege to
> teach, even Freshman calculus. 

Whether Dr. Z puts this ethos into his students, or just happens to attract
ones that already have it, I don't know. But there is obviously something in
the water, so to speak.

It has been a real joy to teach all of my students over the past four years.
Every thankful email I get, every nice (or constructive!) comment in
evaluations, every time someone (unwisely) asks me for a letter of
recommendation, I feel happy that I'm helping someone along. If these awards
reflect anything, they reflect that.
