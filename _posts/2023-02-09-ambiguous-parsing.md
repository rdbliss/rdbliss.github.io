title: Math time with Roman statue profile pictures
---

I recently saw the following photo on the internet.

![](/images/ambiguous-parsing.jpeg)

It was posted by Twitter user [@lporiginalg](https://twitter.com/lporiginalg),
an account with a Roman statue of Socrates profile picture that mostly posts
conservative takes and makes fun of liberals. The idea is that the teacher is
showing young kids two different ways to parse the pictured expression, and
lporiginalg and his followers want to point and laugh because there is only one
right answer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The answer has always been and always will be 1.

Every once in a while a picture like this is posted and righteous internet
users cry that America's education system is falling apart. They often
insinuate that "woke liberals" are making our kids dumber because they declare
all answers equally right, even the wrong ones. Normally I roll my eyes at this
dance, but this one was particularly annoying.

The way we write math is completely arbitrary. Notation and order of operations
is not something that we can "get wrong" the way people imply here.
Conventions exist to make our lives easier. For example, I type a lot of my
math and end up writing things like $1 / 2(x + 1)$ to mean $\frac{1}{2(x + 1)}$.
This is faster to type and saves some keystrokes by avoiding parentheses. Some
of my colleagues might think I mean $\frac{x + 1}{2}$, but we would pretty
quickly understand what the other meant and adjust accordingly. Neither way is
"wrong," it's just an ambiguous expression without a convention telling you
what it means.

We teach students PEMDAS because because it's a useful, common convention. It
isn't "The Law of Math, as Ordained by Our Father in Heaven, Hallowed be His
Name." As we see in the picture, PEMDAS doesn't even resolve every ambiguity
unless you also mention working left-to-right.

The important lesson about order of operations is that a student understands
they *need* an order of operations when parsing an expression. Then they should
understand how PEMDAS+left-to-right parsing is normally used and how to spot
ambiguities, but the conceptual understanding is more important than any
algorithm we give them. To the extent that this picture illustrates that,
I think it reflects well on the lesson. To the extent that people use this
picture to heckle a teacher, I think the whole affair reflects poorly on the
hecklers.
