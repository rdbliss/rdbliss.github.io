title: I hate New Jersey Nazis
hide: true

Last Thursday, members of the Rutgers New Brunswick math department received an
email entitled **Klass Act** with the subject line "**Nazi visiting assistant
professor of mathematics at Rutgers**." The email accuses a former Rutgers
postdoc of running an anonymous Twitter account where he posted racist, sexist,
and, well, Nazi-ish takes.

Having reviewed the evidence, I can say two things:

1. It's definitely him. Digital evidence can always be faked, but barring that
   it's him.

2. The "Nazi" label has some justification. Some tweets were just edgy
   conservative opinions, but others were full-on, all-out, "the Holocaust
   didn't happen and the Aryan race is pure" type takes.

As you can imagine, this has generated some controversy around the department.
Grad students are up in arms, administration is investigating, and word is
getting around to our postdoc's former students. It seems inevitable that
something unpleasant is going to happen to our postdoc.

While I share the general disgust at our postdoc's opinions, and wonder whether
he ever behaved inappropriately with students, I find myself asking: What did
he do *wrong*?

After all, if some punishment is going to be handed out, he must have *done*
something to deserve it. Is it because he had the wrong opinions? Or is it
because he *shared* the wrong opinions? Perhaps we should have rules about what
opinions you are allowed to share?

We would not be the first to try. There is a long history in this country of
banning opinions. Popular victims are folks like draft-dodgers, war-critics,
and socialists. You might enjoy [Ken White's "Three Generations of a Hackneyed
Apologia for Censorship Are
Enough."](https://www.popehat.com/2012/09/19/three-generations-of-a-hackneyed-apologia-for-censorship-are-enough/)
If we take anything from this history, it's that punishing opinions is
a dangerous game to play.

On the contrary, rather than do "wrong," by hiding his opinions on an anonymous
account, our postdoc did "right." If we had never known about his tweets, then
there would be nothing to say, and no harm done.

But we *do* know about his tweets. And soon *lots* of people will know about
them. The genie is out of the bottle. As a result, our postdoc is now
a headache for his employer and a potential source of discomfort for his
students. Just as he has every right to spew hate, the community should have
every right to separate themselves from him.

Despite his awful views, I pity our postdoc. He didn't ask for his opinions to
be thrust upon us. He won't even get the satisfaction of defending his views;
they are far too shameful. He probably goes out with a whimper, afraid to stand
for anything in particular.
