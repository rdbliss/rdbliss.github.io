title: The NSA polygraph interrogation is hypocritical and abusive

I recently had the "good fortune" of being selected to participate in the
National Security Agency's *Graduate Mathematics Program*, a supposedly
prestigious program to attract young mathematicians. I have, in disgust,
withdrawn my application.

I am embarrassed that I waited so long to make this decision. To repent for my
cowardice, I have resolved to never apply to any position in the intelligence
community, and hereby encourage students and colleagues to do the same.

The mathematical community at large has grappled with its relationship with the
NSA. See:

- ["Mathematicians Discuss the Snowden
  Revelations"](https://www.ams.org/notices/201406/rnoti-p623.pdf);

- Tom Leinster's ["The AMS Must Justify Its Support of the NSA"](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/01/the_ams_must_justify_its_suppo.html); and

- the *Just Mathematics Collective*'s recent ["Mathematics Beyond Secrecy and
  Surveillance"](https://www.justmathematicscollective.net/nsa_statement.html).

However, my gripe is different. I am not anti-NSA. In fact, I felt quite
patriotic about devoting time to the agency. I acknowledge the ethical concerns
surrounding the NSA, but also its strategic necessity. I would have proudly
worked there.

My gripe is that the NSA *lies* to their employees and applicants, then
requires them to practice *doublethink* sufficiently well to ignore the lies.

During your security clearance process, should you be so "lucky" to reach this
stage, you will be subjected to a polygraph exam. The so-called "examiner" will
explain that they are there to "help you," that you are both on the "same
team," and that everything will go well if you tell them what's on your mind.

These are lies. The polygraph exam is not an exam, it is an *interrogation*.
Not only is the examiner not on your side, they almost surely assume that you
are on the *other side*. They will use standard interrogation techniques to
trick you into confessing your *wicked ways*.

For example, during one of my polygraph exams, the following exchange occurred:

> **Interrogator:** I would like to verify that you are an honest person by asking you
> some more questions.
>
> **Robert:** Sounds good.
>
> **I:** Trustworthiness is a scale from 0 to 10. Are you a 0 or a 10?
>
> **R:** I suppose I'm pretty close to a 10.
>
> **I:** What does that mean? Are you a 9? So one out of ten times we tell you a
> secret, you'll sell it to the Russians?
>
> **R:** OK, when you put it that way, I'm a 10.
>
> **I:** Excellent. So, during the exam, I will ask you the following: *Have you
> ever lied to cover up a mistake?*
>
> **R:** Surely I have at some point.

At this moment, my interrogator slammed a notepad onto the table and held the
point of his pen over it.

> **I:** Someone who lied to cover up a mistake? That kind of person wouldn't
> work here. I'll ask you again, and if I have to write anything down on this
> paper, we're going to have problems. *Have you ever lied to cover up a
> mistake?*
>
> **R:** No, I have not.

The polygraph interrogator (Mike, or Mark, or Adam, or whatever) asked me a
question to which *he already knew the answer.* Everyone has lied to cover up a
mistake. When I answered truthfully, he responded with anger, suggesting
strongly that I should answer negatively. In other words, the interrogator
*wanted me to lie*.

Given that you are not a *stupid person*, you will immediately recognize this
tactic. Do you respond truthfully or lie as instructed? And once you decide,
how do you ignore that you are now playing a game? That the interrogator is
manipulating you? How do you trust *anything* from their mouth, or anything
that anyone tells you at any point in the security clearance process?

This is but a single moment from my polygraph experience. I sat for a total of
five exams, which totals around twenty hours of interrogation. Each of my five
interrogators proved that every hour, every minute, and every second is an
opportunity for trickery and intimidation. You will be uncomfortable, you will
be tired, and you will probably have strong emotions at some point during the
process. The interrogator does not care. They know that you feel the pressure,
and wouldn't you feel better if you just told them what was on your mind?

The polygraph is a *charade*. It is based on pseudo-science, bluffing, and
deception. It does not detect lies; it elicits confessions. It seems that the
only people that would pass are those *too stupid* to recognize that they are
being toyed with, or those skilled enough to play the game convincingly. I
suspect that it keeps more smart, talented folk *out* than good, honest folk
*in*.

It is *unconscionable* to routinely place anyone in such a catch-22. Therefore
I have adopted a policy that I encourage everyone to follow, no matter your
opinion on the intelligence community: **Refuse polygraph interrogations.**
