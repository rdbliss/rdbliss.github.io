title: COVID Brings Out the Sun for Stormy Petrels Women's Volleyball
date: 2021-06-23

The past year has been strange for sports at all levels. Shortened seasons,
cancelled games, and a surplus of "Out (COVID)" on injury reports. It felt like
everyone, from the NBA to your local rec league, just *barely* got through
their seasons.

You know who *didn't* just barely get through their season? The [Oglethorpe
Stormy Petrels Women's Volleyball
team](https://www.gopetrels.com/sports/wvball/index).

I went to my first Oglethorpe women's volleyball game on September 2, 2017. The
Petrel's took on Illinois Tech in the second game of the 2017 Stormy Petrel
Challenge. Matches are like tennis: Best of 5 sets. The Petrels fell to an
early 0-2 deficit, and the third set seemed lost when they found themselves
down 17-22. Their star player Jacoby Sims scored three quick kills to force an
Illinois timeout at 20-22, and the Petrels rallied to a 26-24 victory. They won
the next two sets by 5 and 3 points, respectively, completing the 3-2 comeback.
I was amazed. The game was fast, explosive, and tense. I couldn't wait to see
the rest of the season.

For the rest of the season, after the Illinois Tech game, the Petrels went on
a 13 game losing streak. They ended the season 4-21 overall, and 2-12 in
conference play, dead last.

You see, the Stormy Petrels are a *terrible* women's volleyball team. I mean
*atrocious*. They have not had a winning season in the past ten years. In those
ten years, they have gone 16-127 in conference play, and never won more than
3 conference games in a single season. Whether we bring in new coaches, new
players, or new staff, it's always the same. The Petrels are the bottom of the
barrel of the Southern Athletic Association, and they have been for a long
time.

And yet, I can't quit them. Even though they're awful, even though no one goes
to the games, and even though I don't live in Georgia anymore, I remember that
thrilling first game I saw. I still hold out hope that maybe *this* is the year
they turn it around.

Finally, *this* year came to pass, and the Stormy Petrels were not a *complete*
joke.

| Season     | Oglethorpe Conference record |
| ------------------------------ |
| **2020-2021** | **6-5** |
| 2019-2020 | 0-16 |
 | 2018-2019 | 2-12 |
 | 2017-2018 | 2-12 |
 | 2016-2017 | 3-11 |
 | 2015-2016 | 0-14 |
 | 2014-2015 | 3-11 |
 | 2013-2014 | 0-14 |
 | 2012-2013 | 2-12 |
 | 2011-2012 | 3-11 |
 | 2010-2011 | 1-14 |

In a shortened, conference-only season, second-year coach Anna Braun led the
Stormy Petrels to a **6-5** finish. You may look at that and say, "Robert,
that's only 55%. It took a shortened season, a COVID-depleted conference, and
over ten years years to *barely* win half of their games?" And while, yes, you
would be correct, this is the Petrel's best percentage, first winning season,
and best conference ranking since joining the SAA over a decade ago. For
Oglethorpe, 6-5 is as good as winning the title.

To explain how amazing this is, I want to provide some context. First we need
to take a detour into the world of analytics.

# Introducing: *Elo*

[*Elo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is a numerical system
used to rate the strength of teams. Arpad Elo first introduced it to rank the
strength of chess players, but it is easily adaptable to any head-to-head
competition. Here's how it works.

An "average" team has an Elo score of 1500. Stronger teams have higher scores,
and weaker teams have lower scores. Your score increases if you win a game, and
decreases if you lose a game. Two teams with equal scores have even odds of
winning, having a score of 70 points higher gives you about a 60% chance of
winning, and having a score of 150 points higher gives you about a 70% chance
of winning.

| Elo difference | Win probability for stronger team |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
|0|50%|
|75|60.5%|
|150|70%|
|300|85%|
|600|97%|

You get a higher Elo score by winning games, and a lower score by losing games.
How much your score changes depends on the following ideas:

1. A strong team beating a weak team gets a small score bump. (We expect strong
   teams to beat weak teams.)

2. A strong team beating a strong team gets a moderate score bump. (We learn
   about the strong teams, but not their relation to a third, weaker team.)

3. A weak team beating a strong team gets a *big* score bump. (This is the most
   surprising situation.)

The "base change" is 40 Elo points. That's the most you could increase or
decrease after a game. You get a proportion of that that depends on your odds
of winning or losing the game. If you win, then you get 40 times the
probability that you would lose. If you lose, then you lose 40 times the
probability that you would win. For the other side, Elo is a zero-sum game: The
loser's score goes down the exact amount the winner's goes up.

Let's see some examples.

If an average team (Elo 1500) met another average team (Elo 1500), we'd predict
that both teams have a 50% chance to win. The winner had a 50% of losing, so
they would get 20 points (Elo 1520) and the loser would fall 20 points (Elo
1480).

If an average team (Elo 1500) met an above average team (Elo 1600), we'd
predict that the above average team has about a 64% chance to win. If the
stronger team won, then they would only get 36% of 40, or 14 points (Elo 1614),
while the average team would only fall 14 points (Elo 1496). If, on the other
hand, the *average* team won, then they would get 64% of 40, or 26 points (Elo
1526), while the stronger team would fall 26 points (Elo 1574).

With this description of Elo out of the way, let's see the history of the SAA
in a graph.

![Elo scores](/images/elo.png)

Using data compiled from the 2012-2013 season to the 2019-2020 season,
I computed the Elo scores of every women's volleyball team in the SAA and
plotted them above. (I left out one team, Sewanee, because they didn't play in
the 2020-2021 season.) The graph shows a clear divide into three groups:

1. **The pack leaders,** Berry, Birmingham-Southern, and Hendrix. These teams
   have always been at least average, and have been moderately to very strong
   in recent years.

2. **The middling runts,** Rhodes, Centre, and Millsaps. These teams were
   decent a while ago, but have been in a sharp decline recently. They are
   firmly below average.

3. **The Stormy Petrels,** the dregs of the SAA.

Now that we have some context for how bad the Stormy Petrels are, 6-5 doesn't
sound so bad, does it? How does Oglethorpe's Elo look after this miraculous
winning season?

![Elo redux](../images/elo2.png)

Oglethorpe's Elo *skyrocketed* after this barely-winning year. The wins came
from Centre (x2), Hendrix, Rhodes, and Millsaps (x2). The losses came from
Birmingham-Southern (x3), Rhodes, and Hendrix. Except for Rhodes, which nearly
cancels out, the losses were to teams so overpowered that they barely lowered
Oglethorpe's rating. The wins, since Oglethorpe had such a meagre rating,
produced much more.

# A postseason shocker: simulating with Elo

The *real* shocker is that 6-4 was enough to put the Stormy Petrels into the
SAA playoffs with their first top-4 finish *ever*. We can quantify how
surprising this was by *simulating* the 2020-2021 season.

Once we know the Elo score of two teams, we can simulate a matchup between them
by flipping a biased coin. If Elo says the stronger team has a 75% chance to
win, then we flip a coin that comes up heads 75% of the time, and tails 25% of
the time. If we see heads, then the stronger team "won," and otherwise they
"lost." Proceeding in this way, we can simulate an entire season of games as
long as we know the Elo scores of the teams involved to a sufficiently high
accuracy.

I simulated the 2020-2021 season 10,000 times and figured out how likely it was
that each team made the playoffs. Oglethorpe had around a 20% chance, which is
probably their best chance at finishing top-4 in a *long* time. The three
top-dogs (Berry, Birmingham-Southern, Hendrix) all made the playoffs, so
Oglethorpe had to leap over the middle-of-the-pack teams (Centre, Rhodes,
Millsaps) to get fourth place.

| Team | Probability of top-4 SAA finish (bold = actual) |
|----------------------------------------|
|**Berry**|                  **97.92%** |
|**Birmingham-Southern**|    **96.78%** |
|**Hendrix**|                **85.73%** |
|Millsaps|               53.29% |
|Centre|                 26.08% |
|Rhodes|                 21.09% |
|**Oglethorpe**|             **19.11%** |

A 20% event happens, on average, once every five times, so it isn't so crazy
that Oglethorpe would make the top-4. They lost in the first round, but that's
to be expected. Going any further first round would probably require beating
a big-dog team, and accordingly the probability that Oglethorpe would win the
SAA title was exceedingly small.

| Team | Probability of winning SAA title (bold = actual) |
|------------------------------------------|
|Berry|                  38.73%|
|**Birmingham-Southern**|    **34.09%**|
|Hendrix|                18.22%|
|Millsaps|               4.17%|
|Centre|                 2.72%|
|Rhodes|                 1.31%|
|Oglethorpe|             0.76%|

# What's next for the Stormy Petrels?

Hot off their highest finish in a decade, where do the Stormy Petrels go? Will
the new coach lead us to glory? Will she crash and burn how all the rest have?
We don't know for sure, but all the machinery I've laid out here will enable us
to make predictions about the next season. As soon as the schedule is released
I'll be churning those out.

My mind tells me that the likeliest outcome is for Oglethorpe to have
a terrible year, like we always do. My heart tells me that we're going to win
it all, baby.
