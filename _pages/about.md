I was born in the town of Aiken, South Carolina in 1997. My parents, Drew Bliss
and Tina Dougherty, were born in Michigan and New Jersey, respectively. The
Dougherty family came to the United States in the mid 1800's from Ireland. The
'Dough' of Dougherty is pronounced like 'Loch' in 'Loch Ness Monster', or you
can think 'dock-er-tee'. The [Bliss
family](https://archive.org/details/genealogyofbliss00blis) has been in America
for a long time.

I moved to Lugoff, South Carolina as a small kid and bounced between there and
Elgin until I graduated high school. I mostly studied computer repair and
programming in school, but eventually focused on math thanks to my
teaching-hero, David Caldwell.

I graduated from Oglethorpe University, a tiny liberal arts college in Atlanta,
in 2019. Other than all the math I learned, I heard a lot of exciting lectures
on history, philosophy, art, and much more. I wish math had more chances to
talk about life's Big Questions. (Oh well, back to teaching calculus!)

I received my PhD in 2024 under Doron Zeilberger at Rutgers University. I first
learned about Zeilberger by reading a copy of his book *A = B* I found in the
basement of Oglethorpe's library. As far as I know I was the only person to
ever check this book out, so that might be the most influential copy ever sold,
percentage-wise.

In 2024 I was hired to work under the puzzle master Peter Winkler as an
Instructor of Applied and Computational Math at Dartmouth College.
