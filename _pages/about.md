I was born in [Aiken](https://www.visitaikensc.com/), South Carolina, in 1997.
Aiken is close to the Georgia-South Carolina border, and has a far better
website than it deserves. I moved to
[Lugoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugoff,_South_Carolina) at a young age
and lived either there or in
[Elgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin,_Kershaw_County,_South_Carolina)
until I graduated high school. These two small towns are slightly northeast of
[Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina), South
Carolina's capital. At this point I went by Robert Bliss rather than Robert
Dougherty-Bliss. (A different, more notable Robert Bliss was an artist fond of
painting scantily clad young men. The paintings are quite good, but not mine!)

I spent time studying computer repair and programming in high school, but was
eventually swayed to persue math my Senior year by some excellent teachers. I
briefly considered studying theater for the same reason. I left South Carolina
for Georgia and took up residence at Oglethorpe University in
[Brookhaven](https://www.brookhavenga.gov/), a suburb of Atlanta. Being a
liberal arts school, Oglethorpe gave me a healthy exposure to philosophy and
the arts as well as (and at the expense of) math.
