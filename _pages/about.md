I was born in [Aiken](), South Carolina, a town close to the Georgia-South
Carolina border. I moved to [Lugoff]() at a young age and lived either there or
in [Elgin]() until I graduated high school. These two small towns, of little
note themselves, are a little ways northeast from [Columbia](), South
Carolina's capital. At this point I went by Robert Bliss rather than Robert
Dougherty-Bliss.

I spent time studying computer repair in high school, but was eventually swayed
to persue math my Senior year by some excellent teachers. I briefly considered
studying theater for the same reason. I left South Carolina for Georgia and
took up residence at Oglethorpe University in [Brookhaven](), a suburb of
Atlanta. Aside from the many reasons to visit Atlanta, the drive between
Georgia and South Carolina is quite beautiful. I highly recommend passing over
the Savannah River at least once.
