I was born in the town of [Aiken](https://www.visitaikensc.com/), South
Carolina in 1997. I moved to the small town of
[Lugoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugoff,_South_Carolina) at a young age
and lived somewhere between there and the even-smaller
[Elgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin,_Kershaw_County,_South_Carolina)
until I graduated high school. At this point I went by Robert Bliss rather than
Robert Dougherty-Bliss. (There's a *different* Robert Bliss who painted
nearly-naked men.)

I studied computer repair and programming in high school, but was eventually
swayed to pursue math my Senior year by my teaching-hero, David Caldwell.
I graduated from Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, where I got a healthy dose
of philosophy and arts in addition to math.

I received my PhD in math in 2024 under my advisor Doron Zeilberger at Rutgers
University. I first learned about Zeilberger by reading a copy of his book *A
= B* I found in my undergraduate library. As far as I know I was the only
person to ever check this book out, so that might be the most influential copy
of that book ever sold, percentage-wise.

In 2024 I was hired to work under the puzzle master Peter Winkler as an
Instructor of Applied and Computational Math at Dartmouth College.
