I was born in the town of [Aiken](https://www.visitaikensc.com/), South
Carolina, in 1997. I moved to the small town of
[Lugoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugoff,_South_Carolina) at a young age
and lived either there or in
[Elgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin,_Kershaw_County,_South_Carolina)
until I graduated high school. Elgin is a tiny, out-of-the-way town. They
recently added their second (!) stoplight. At this point I went by Robert Bliss
rather than Robert Dougherty-Bliss. (There's a *different* Robert Bliss who
painted nearly-naked men.)

I spent time studying computer repair and programming in high school, but was
eventually swayed to pursue math my Senior year by some excellent teachers.
I briefly considered studying theater for the same reason. I left South
Carolina for Georgia and took up residence at Oglethorpe University in
[Brookhaven](https://www.brookhavenga.gov/), a suburb of Atlanta. Oglethorpe
gave me a healthy exposure to philosophy and the arts as well as (and sometimes
at the expense of) math. I have very fond memories of my time at Oglethorpe and
the people I knew there.

In 2019 I came to the mathematics department at Rutgers University in New
Brunswick, New Jersey to begin a PhD.
