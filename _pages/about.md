I am a graduate student in the math department at Rutgers University. Other
than math, I am also interested in computer science, philosophy, and politics,
though I am merely a journeyman in these subjects. You may know me from my time
at [Oglethorpe
University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oglethorpe_University), or even
further back from my time at [Lugoff-Elgin
Highschool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lugoff-Elgin_High_School).

This site contains some information about me and a blog where I post ideas.
Most of the ideas are about math. Some are even good!
