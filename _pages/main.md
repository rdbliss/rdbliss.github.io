I am a graduate student in the [math department at Rutgers
University](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/) under [Doron
Zeilberger](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/). Other than math, I am
also interested in computer science, philosophy, and music. You may know me
from my time at [Oglethorpe University](https://oglethorpe.edu/), or even
further back from my time at [Lugoff-Elgin High
School](https://www.kcsdschools.net/Domain/17).

This site contains some information about me and a blog where I post ideas.
Most of the ideas are about math. Some are even good!

Currently at Rutgers, I co-organize the *Graduate Pizza* and *Experimental
Mathematics* seminars, am the Vice President of our AMS chapter, and serve on
the graduate Liaison Committee.
