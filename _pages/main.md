I am an instructor of applied and computational mathematics at Dartmouth
College. My research focuses on applying symbolic and numeric computation to
problems in combinatorics or number theory. I'm always interested in finding
new mathematical applications of computers.

My work on primality testing was written about in [*Pour la
Science*](https://www.pourlascience.fr/sr/logique-calcul/des-nombres-premiers-aux-pseudo-premiers-26266.php).
My own expository work has appeared in the [*American Mathematical
Monthly*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2022.2104069).
Two of my articles were cited in
[*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03229-4) and the
[*Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences*](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2321440121).

The rest of this site contains some information about me, my work, and a blog
where I post ideas. Some of the ideas are even good!

My CV is [here](/files/cv.pdf).

I was born in the year $\lfloor \pi^6 / \log \varphi \rfloor$, which makes me
$\lceil e \pi^2 \rceil$ years old. [Try to find your own
age!](https://www.mrob.com/pub/ries/index.html)
