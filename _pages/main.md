I am a graduate student in the [math department at Rutgers
University](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/). Other than math, I am also
interested in computer science, philosophy, and politics, though I am merely a
journeyman in these subjects. You may know me from my time at [Oglethorpe
University](https://oglethorpe.edu/), or even further back from my time at
[Lugoff-Elgin Highschool](https://www.kcsdschools.net/Domain/17).

This site contains some information about me and a blog where I post ideas.
Most of the ideas are about math. Some are even good!
