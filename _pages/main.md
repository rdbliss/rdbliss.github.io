I am a graduate student in the [math department at Rutgers
University](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/) under [Doron
Zeilberger](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/). You may know me from
[Oglethorpe University](https://oglethorpe.edu/), or even further back from
[Lugoff-Elgin High School](https://lhs.kcsdschools.net/).

This site contains some information about me and a blog where I post ideas.
Many of the ideas are about math. Some are even good!

Currently at Rutgers, I co-organize the *Experimental Mathematics* seminar and
am the President of our AMS chapter.

My CV is [here](/files/cv.pdf).
