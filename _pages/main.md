I am an instructor of applied and computational mathematics at Dartmouth
College. You may know me from [Rutgers
University](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/banim.html), where
I worked under Doron Zeilberger, from my time at [Oglethorpe
University](https://oglethorpe.edu/), or even further back from [Lugoff-Elgin
High School](https://lhs.kcsdschools.net/).

My research focuses on applying symbolic and numeric computational methods to
various mathematical problems. These problems are typically in combinatorics or
number theory, but I'm always interested in finding new places computers can be
helpful.

This site contains some information about me, my work, and a blog where I post
ideas. Some are even good!

My CV is [here](/files/cv.pdf).
