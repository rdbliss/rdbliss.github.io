My undergraduate thesis is about the expressive complexity of computer algebra
systems. Roughly, it tries to measure which computer algebra systems are the
simplest to use. This was inspired by recent attempts by [experimental
mathematicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_mathematics) and
logicians to automate exploration and proof writing. For a friendly
introduction to expressive complexity, I recommend [the post that I wrote about
it](/ergonomics-in-computer-science). The thesis will be available on GitHub
when I get around to it.

More specifically, my thesis compares [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/) and
[SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). The former is a standalone,
commercial product, and the latter is a pure Python library. I am fairly
familiar with Maple from various classes at Oglethorpe University. It always
seemed clunky in comparison to other languages when I wanted to write a "real"
program, and my thesis gives a way to make this feeling precise.
