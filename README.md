# Issa me

This repository is small jekyll site for me to put some information up onto the
web. It mentions who I am, what I'm doing, and contains a small blog where
I may write things from time to time.

The site was forked from the [academicpages
repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
